# InitializeMe / Phoenix
Creates a custom initializer from a list of properties

Main Features:
- Respects `nonnull` with a corresponding `NSParameterAssert`
- Respects `copy` qualifier.
- Supports Objective-C and Swift


Also provided here is **Phoenix** - an Xcode plugin that allows you select the properties and create your custom initializer.
- Select your properties
- Go to Edit and then click Make Initializer And Copy OR use the key command CMD - Shift - X.
- Paste your initializer wherever you wish 

You can install Phoenix by either...

- Install via [alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io)
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/Pearapps/InitializeMe/releases) and download the plugin and put it in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`
- You can build this project and it will be installed.

You should then restart Xcode, and enjoy!

### What is next

- I want to add the ability to copy just the declaration of the initializer.
